## Introduction

* One of the hardest things in bioinformatics is developing a **good** file format

* It might seem trivial, but a lot of effort is put into developing file formats that are **efficient** yet can be **quickly** and **easily** parsed

* Around the storage of primary sequences, FASTA/Q have become the de-facto standard

* Many have tried to come up with *better* formats, but none have prevailed

## FASTA

### Overview

* Text-based format for representing either nucleotide or amino acid sequences

* Nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes:

  * IUPAC ambiguous DNA: `GATCRYWSMKHBVDN`
  * IUPAC protein alphabet of the **20** standard amino acids: `ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY`

* A FASTA file uses two or more lines per record:

  * The header line begins with `>` and gives a unique identifier for the sequence
  * The sequence line(s) contain the actual sequence and are wrapped every **80** characters

* Filename extensions: `.fasta` `.fa`

```{embed, file = "data/formats/example.fasta", echo = TRUE}
```

---

## FASTA

### Header line

<br>

```{r, out.width = "85%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fasta-identifier-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

* The header line begins with `>` and gives a unique identifier for the sequence

* The header line may also contain additional information:

    * NCBI Identifiers:
    
        * GenInfo integrated database `gi|integer`
        * GenBank `gb|accession`
        * Definition `text`
        * Organism `[organism]`

---

## FASTA

### Sequence lines(s)

<br>

```{r, out.width = "85%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fasta-sequence-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

* The sequence line(s) contain the actual sequence and are wrapped every **80** characters

* Expected to be represented in the standard IUB/IUPAC amino acid and nucleic acid codes

* In genome assembly sequences, repeat regions are sometimes masked:

  * Sort mask: `atatatatatat`
  
  * Hard mask: `NNNNNNNNNNNN`
  
* *Warning! Always check the wrapping on your sequences and the validation performed by the bioinformatics software - some poorly written software will only read the first 80 characters, skipping any which appear afterward!*

## FASTA

### Alignment representation

.pull-left-50[

* The FASTA format can also be used to store multiple sequence alignment output

* Sequences are padded using the `-` character to represent insertions and deletions 

* The FASTA format was originally designed as a protein sequence similarity searching format (FASTP) in the 1980's

* Over time the need grew for a simple and flexible way to query DNA and protein sequences against entire databases

## FASTQ

### Overview

.pull-left-55[

* An extension of FASTA format to handle base quality metrics from sequencing machines

* Each sequence is represented by 4 lines:

  1. Identifier of the sequence starting with `@`
  2. Actual sequence
  3. Optional identifier starting with `+`
  4. Quality scores for each base
  
* FASTQ files are created and compressed with extension `.fastq.gz`

* For each sample per flow cell lane:

  * Single-end: `.fastq.gz`
  * Paired-end: `_1.fastq.gz` `_2.fastq.gz`

## FASTQ

### Sequence identifier

<br>

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fastq-identifier-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

.pull-left-45[

* Contains information about the sequencing run and the cluster

* Contents vary based on the BCL to FASTQ software version

* Record starts with the `@` character

* Line contains 11 elements separated by the `:` character

]

.pull-right-50[

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/formats/FASTQ.csv")

kbl <- kable(dat[, 1:2], "html", align = "l")

for (i in 1:12) {

  kbl <- row_spec(kbl, i, color = dat$Colour[i])

}

kbl <- scroll_box(kbl, height = "300px")

kbl
```

]

---

## FASTQ

### Sequence

<br>

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fastq-sequence-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

* Contains the **base calls** for the sequenced read

* Read length refers to the number of base calls: `36`

* The base calls are limited to `ACGTN`

* An `N` means the software was not able to make a call for this base

* Multiple `N` base calls may indicate a problem with the sequencing

---

## FASTQ

### Optional identifier

<br>

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fastq-description-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

* Contains **optional** identifier or description

* Begins with a `+` character

* Somtimes contains a copy of the sequence identifier

---

## FASTQ

### Quality scores

<br>

```{r, out.width = "60%"}
include_graphics("data/formats/fastq-quality-coloured.jpg")
```

<br>

.pull-left-50[

* A quality score is an integer mapping of the probability of an **incorrect** base call

* Use ASCII characters to represent the numerical probability

* Phred quality score calculation: $Q=-10\log_{{10}}P$

]

.pull-right-45[

```{r}
dat <- read.delim("data/formats/PHRED.tsv", check.names = FALSE)

kbl <- kable(dat, "html", align = "r") %>% kable_styling(font_size = 15)

kbl
```

]

---

## FASTQ

### Quality encoding

* Different sequencing manufacturers use different quality encoding schemes

* Encodings are limited to the **printable** ASCII characters (33-126)

* Most data you will encounter will use **Phred+33** encoding - *but always check!*

```{r, out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "Phred quality score encoding (Wikipedia)"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/formats/quality-encoding.jpg")
```

## Processing FASTA/Q

* There are multiple libraries and tools available to process FASTA/Q files

* Because FASTA/Q files can be very large, there has been a lot of effort devoted to developing faster and faster algorithms for reading such files

* See this [blog post](http://lh3.github.io/2020/05/17/fast-high-level-programming-languages) by Heng Li if you are *algorithimically inclined*

* Examples of some popular libraries:

  * [Biopython](https://biopython.org)
  
  * [Biostrings](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Biostrings.html) and [ShortRead](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html) from [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org) 

* Examples of some popular tools:

  * [Seqkit](https://bioinf.shenwei.me/seqkit/)
  
  * [seqtk](https://github.com/lh3/seqtk)

## Biopython

### Overview

```{r, fig.align = "right", out.width = "20%"}
knitr::include_graphics("data/formats/biopython-logo.png")
```

* Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological computation written in Python by an international team of developers

* It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and applications which address the needs of current and future work in bioinformatics

* It contains classes to represent biological sequences and sequence annotations, and it is able to read and write to a variety of file formats

* It also allows for a programmatic means of accessing online databases of biological information, such as those at NCBI

* Separate modules extend Biopython's capabilities to sequence alignment, protein structure, population genetics, phylogenetics, sequence motifs, and machine learning
